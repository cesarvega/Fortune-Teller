Your Firebase project has been set up with the following details:
- **Project ID**: fortune-teller-2025-ios
- **Project Name**: Fortune Teller iOS App
- **Bundle ID**: com.cesarvega.fortune-teller
- **App ID**: 1:964869805249:ios:6bb3b777ccab8b90c7b040

## Next Steps:

### 1. Add Firebase SDK to Xcode Project

In Xcode:
1. Go to **File > Add Package Dependencies**

   - **GoogleSignIn** (for Google Sign-In)
   - **FirebaseCore** (required)

### 2. Add GoogleService-Info.plist to Xcode

⚠️ **SECURITY NOTE**: The GoogleService-Info.plist file contains sensitive API keys and should NEVER be committed to version control.

1. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from Firebase Console (Project Settings > Your apps)
2. In Xcode, right-click on your project folder
3. Select **Add Files to "Fortune-Teller"**
4. Navigate to and select the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
5. Make sure **Add to target** is checked for your app target
6. **IMPORTANT**: The file is already in .gitignore - do NOT commit it to git

### 3. Configure Bundle Identifier

In Xcode:
1. Select your project in the navigator
2. Go to your app target
3. In **General** tab, set **Bundle Identifier** to: `com.cesarvega.fortune-teller`

### 4. Enable Authentication Methods in Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **Fortune Teller iOS App**
3. Go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
4. Enable:
   - **Email/Password** authentication
   - **Google** authentication (configure OAuth consent screen)

### 5. For Google Sign-In Setup:

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication > Sign-in method > Google**
2. Enable Google sign-in
3. Download the updated `GoogleService-Info.plist` if needed
4. In Xcode, add a URL scheme:
   - Go to your target's **Info** tab
   - Expand **URL Types**
   - Add a new URL scheme with the **REVERSED_CLIENT_ID** from your `GoogleService-Info.plist`

## Features Now Available:

✅ **Email/Password Sign-in and Sign-up**
✅ **Google Sign-In integration**
✅ **Automatic auth state management**
✅ **Error handling with Firebase error messages**
